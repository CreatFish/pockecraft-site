            <li>We are not liable for any damages resulting from the use of generated tools</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Subscriptions</h2>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the app at any time, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users or us.</p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the app developer resides, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
